		<blockquote cite="https://gizmodo.com/cdc-warns-doctors-about-a-mystery-bacterial-outbreak-wi-1847210820">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning doctors about 
		a strange cluster of illness in three states caused by a rarely seen 
		bacteria in the U.S., one that’s killed at least one person and hospitalized
		two others so far. The illness, called melioidosis, can be highly fatal but
		isn’t normally considered contagious between people. Officials don’t know 
		how these victims contracted the bacteria, though the cases do seem to be 
		connected.</blockquote>
		<p>Since March 2021, the CDC announced in a health alert on Wednesday, at 
		least three people in three non-adjacent states (Kansas, Texas, and Minnesota)
		are known to have contracted melioidosis. The first victim, a man with 
		preexisting lung and liver issues, died 10 days into his hospitalization. 
		The other two, a woman and child, were identified in May. And while one 
		patient has since been discharged to a transitional care unit, the other 
		remains hospitalized.</p>
		<p>
			According to a report from The Center for Food Security and Public 
			Health at Iowa State University, the bacteria has never been found 
			in the natural environments of North America, at least as of January 
			2016 when the report was last updated. So when cases in the U.S are 
			rarely identified, they’re usually traced back to travel to a country 
			where it’s endemic. That doesn’t seem to be the explanation here, 
			though, since none of the patients’ families had reported any travel 
			out of the country or far from their homes lately. But the cases do 
			appear to be linked in some way, because all three were infected with
			genetically similar strains of the bacteria.
		</p>
		<p>“Testing suggests a common source of infection, but that source has 
		not yet been identified,” the agency said. “CDC is working with states to 
		assess exposures or products these individuals have in common, as well as 
		environmental samples from the states where cases have been identified. 
		Additionally, CDC experts are providing epidemiologic assistance to help 
		investigate the cause of infection.”
